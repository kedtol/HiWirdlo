# HiWirdlo
This is a basic bomberman style game programmed in java.
This project supports 3d gameworlds.

# Current features:
 - 3d space (I'm storing it in a 3d array)
 - Id list which connects the textures and the map.
 - Player: It can move in all 6 directions.
 - Camera: Currently shows 2 axles at the same time, but you can choose which are those.
 - Power Ups: We've got 5 power ups currently - Speed boost,Bomb bag,Bomb strength booster,Bomb pushing, and 3d bombs.
 - Map: Random or fix.

# Todo:
 - Online multiplayer (up to 8 players)
 - Proper camera which supports alpha layering (and somewhat easy to understand).
 - Menu (where you can start the game or join one)
 - (maybe a map editor)

Ps: don't ask about the name
